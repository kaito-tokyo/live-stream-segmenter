/**
 * @brief A high-performance, thread-safe asynchronous MPSC Channel.
 *
 * @details
 * This class implements a **Multiple Producer, Single Consumer (MPSC)** queue
 * designed for C++20 coroutines. It allows multiple threads (or coroutines) to
 * send data safely, while a single consumer coroutine receives and processes them.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - **MPSC Design**: Safe for concurrent calls to `send()`, but requires strictly
 * one active awaiter on `receive()` at a time.
 * - **Zero-Overhead Suspension**: Uses `std::coroutine_handle` to suspend the
 * receiver directly without blocking OS threads.
 * - **Graceful Shutdown**: Supports a `close()` operation that allows the consumer
 * to drain remaining items before terminating.
 * - **Exception Safety**: Enforces `noexcept` move semantics via `ChannelMessage`.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of message to transport. Must satisfy `ChannelMessage`.
